# Introduction to Wireframing

Wireframing is the process of creating a simplified, visual blueprint or skeletal framework of a website or application. It focuses on outlining the basic structure, layout, and functionality of a user interface without getting distracted by detailed design elements like colors, fonts, or images.

## Importance of Wireframing in the Design Process

Wireframing plays a crucial role in the design process as it helps translate abstract ideas into tangible representations. It allows designers, developers, and stakeholders to visualize and communicate the layout and user flow early on, making it easier to identify usability issues and make changes before investing time and resources into high-fidelity designs or development. This flexibility encourages experimentation and ensures that the final product meets both user needs and project goals.
